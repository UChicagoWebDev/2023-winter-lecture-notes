# Policies and Grading
- Exercises
  - Each week for the first six weeks (starting today!)
  - Due each week before class
  - Get harder over time and build on each other, so be sure to stay current

???

This class is all about writing software, and your grade will be based entirely
on the software you write, instead of tests or quizzes.

Exercises are due each week right before class (so that students aren't tempted
to skip lecture in order to finish last week's homework). Push your submissions
to your student repo on GitHub at https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/97002355-uchicago-web-development-winter-2023.
For ease of grading, please then submit the URL of your submission on Canvas.

Exercises are graded on a ten-point scale, according to the rubric at the
bottom of the exercise description. This course is a lot of work, but the scoring
is relatively generous. There is no curve, and no reason in principle everyone 
can't receive an excellent grade.

Things happen, and sometimes deadlines get missed. Ask for an extension. Work
handed in late without an extension will be accepted with a 1-point penalty, 
plus an additional 1 point for each full week the assignment is late. Do be 
careful not to be cavalier about due dates though; there is another assignment 
every week and they generally increase in complexity, so it can be very hard 
to catch up if you fall too far behind. If you're struggling with the 
assignments please reach out right away on Slack or in office hours.

# Policies and Grading
- Final Project
  - Like an Exercise, but bigger
  - With a little extra work, makes a good portfolio piece

???

Instead of a final exam. we'll cap the quarter off with a final project, which
will incorporate everything we've learned into a single web application.
Submission and grading works just like a regular exercise, except that you have
longer to work on it and it's worth 40 points instead of 10. For those of you
that are interested, it is also designed to be a suitable portfolio piece you
can add to your public git profile and use while interviewing.

# Policies and Grading
- Collaboration
  - Type your own code
  - Include attribution for resources you use and people you collaborate with

???

In the real world, software development is a very collaborative process. And
because web development is especially fast-moving, a key objective of this
course if for students to learn how to learn new techniques by studying other
sites and consulting online resources. Accordingly, students are encouraged to
collaborate on assignments, and to use any resources they find helpful.

To do that in a way consistent with the University's academic honesty policy, we
have two simple rules. First, everyone turns in their own work on their own
GitLab. That doesn't just mean no group submissions; literally type it out
yourself. Don't copy and paste, you'll learn much less. Second, include
attribution for the people you worked with or the resources you consulted. Code
comments or a README are good ways of doing this.
