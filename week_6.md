# Single Page Applications (SPAs)

> A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
> 
> In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

# Path

---
# Path, Routing, and History
Look at our example application in `mpa`.

We're going to modify it to simulate it being very slow to load.
---

# Path, Routing, and History
`spa` only loads once, then switches between animals instantly with javascript.

But what if we want to be able to link to `/cat`? What if we want `/bear` in
our browser history?

Modify the example app in `spa/` so that the animal we pick as best goes into
our browser history. Make sure that if we load the page with that URL, the
correct animal is identified as best.
